# Multi2vec Bind module

# Local setup

This module works with Python 3.8 version. The best way to start working with it would be to first to create a virtual env, activate it and adjust `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to have the modules to be visible to python.

```sh
python3.8 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}:${PWD}/ImageBind"
```
